React + Vite
This starter setup offers a lightweight configuration to run React with Vite, including Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and basic ESLint rules.

There are currently two official plugins you can choose from:

@vitejs/plugin-react — utilizes Babel for Fast Refresh

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — leverages SWC for Fast Refresh

Enhancing ESLint Configuration
For production-level applications, it’s best to use TypeScript along with type-aware linting rules. You can explore the TypeScript-based template, which integrates typescript-eslint for stricter code quality and type safety.
